**Step 1: Install Rspamd**

The first thing you need to do is install Rspamd on your system. You can do this by following these steps:

1.1 Update your system's package list:

```
sudo apt update
```

1.2 Install Rspamd:

```
sudo apt install rspamd
```

**Step 2: Configure Rspamd**

Now that you have installed Rspamd, you need to configure it to work as a mail proxy. Here's how you can do that:

2.1 Configure the main Rspamd configuration file:

Edit the `rspamd.conf` file, which is located in the `/etc/rspamd/` directory. You can use any text editor of your choice to edit the file. For example:

```
sudo nano /etc/rspamd/rspamd.conf
```

In this file, you can configure various aspects of Rspamd, such as the ports it listens on, the modules it uses, and the filters it applies to incoming email.

2.2 Configure the SMTP proxy:

In the `rspamd.conf` file, you need to enable the SMTP proxy module. Find the following line in the file:

```
# smtp {
#   enabled = false;
#   bind_socket = "*:11332";
# }
```

Remove the `#` symbols at the beginning of the lines to enable the module, and set the `bind_socket` parameter to the port you want the SMTP proxy to listen on. For example:

```
smtp {
  enabled = true;
  bind_socket = "*:25";
}
```

This example sets the SMTP proxy to listen on port 25.

2.3 Configure the DKIM signing module:

If you want to sign outgoing email with DKIM, you need to enable the DKIM signing module. Find the following line in the `rspamd.conf` file:

```
# dkim_signing {
#   enabled = false;
#   selector = "default";
#   domain = "example.com";
#   path = "/var/lib/rspamd/dkim/%s.%d.key";
# }
```

Remove the `#` symbols at the beginning of the lines to enable the module, and set the `selector` and `domain` parameters to match your DKIM configuration. You can also change the `path` parameter to specify the location where the DKIM keys should be stored.

2.4 Configure other modules:

There are many other modules you can configure in Rspamd, depending on your needs. Some examples include:

- The Greylisting module: This module can help reduce spam by temporarily rejecting incoming email from unknown senders. To enable this module, find the following line in the `rspamd.conf` file:

```
# greylist {
#   enabled = false;
#   expire = 1d;
#   auto_whitelist = false;
# }
```

Remove the `#` symbols at the beginning of the lines to enable the module, and configure the `expire` and `auto_whitelist` parameters as desired.

- The Bayesian filtering module: This module can help filter out spam by learning from previous email messages. To enable this module, find the following line in the `rspamd.conf` file:

```
# bayes {
#   classifier = "redis";
#   backend = "redis";
# }
```

Remove the `#` symbols at the beginning of the lines to enable the module, and configure the `classifier` and `backend` parameters as desired.

2.5 Restart Rspamd:

After making anychanges to the `rspamd.conf` file, you need to restart Rspamd to apply the changes. You can do this by running the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart rspamd
```

**Step 3: Configure your mail server to use Rspamd**

Now that you have configured Rspamd as a mail proxy, you need to configure your mail server to use it. The specific steps to do this will depend on your mail server software, but in general, you need to configure the following settings:

- Set the SMTP server hostname to the hostname of your Rspamd server.
- Set the SMTP server port to the port you configured for the SMTP proxy in the `rspamd.conf` file.
- Configure the DKIM settings to match the DKIM configuration you set up in the `rspamd.conf` file.

Here are some examples of how to configure Rspamd with popular mail server software:

- Postfix: Edit the `/etc/postfix/main.cf` file and set the following settings:

```
smtpd_milters = inet:127.0.0.1:11332
non_smtpd_milters = inet:127.0.0.1:11332
milter_protocol = 6
milter_mail_macros = i {mail_addr} {client_addr} {client_name} {auth_authen}
milter_default_action = accept
```

- Exim: Edit the `/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template` file and add the following settings:

```
milters = inet:127.0.0.1:11332
milter_protocol = 6
milter_mail_macros = i {mail_addr} {client_addr} {client_name} {auth_authen}
```

- Sendmail: Edit the `/etc/mail/sendmail.mc` file and add the following setting:

```
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`rspamd', `S=inet:127.0.0.1:11332')
```

After making these changes, restart your mail server software to apply the configuration.

**Step 4: Test your setup**

To test your Rspamd setup, you can send a test email to an external email address, and check if the email is received and if DKIM signing is working correctly. You can use an online tool such as `dkimvalidator.com` to check if your emails are correctly signed with DKIM.
