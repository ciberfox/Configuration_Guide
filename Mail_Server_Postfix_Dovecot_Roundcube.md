1. Install the necessary software
First, make sure you have Postfix, SpamAssassin, and Dovecot installed on your Linux machine. If you're using a Debian-based distribution, you can install them using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install postfix spamassassin dovecot-core dovecot-imapd dovecot-pop3d
```

2. Configure Postfix
Postfix is a mail transfer agent (MTA) that is responsible for sending and receiving email. You'll need to configure it to work with your domain name and SMTP settings. 

The configuration file for Postfix is located at `/etc/postfix/main.cf`. Open it with your preferred text editor and make the following changes:

```
myhostname = yourdomain.com
mydestination = yourdomain.com, localhost.localdomain, localhost
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128
inet_interfaces = all
```

These settings tell Postfix to use your domain name for email, to accept mail from localhost and your network, and to use all available network interfaces.

3. Configure SpamAssassin
SpamAssassin is a spam filter that can help you keep unwanted messages out of your inbox. You'll need to configure it to work with Postfix.

The configuration file for SpamAssassin is located at `/etc/spamassassin/local.cf`. Open it with your preferred text editor and make the following changes:

```
required_score 5.0
report_safe 0
rewrite_header Subject [SPAM]
```

These settings tell SpamAssassin to mark messages as spam if they score 5 or higher, to not modify the message body, and to add "[SPAM]" to the subject line of messages that are marked as spam.

4. Configure Dovecot
Dovecot is an email server that is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from your inbox. You'll need to configure it to work with Postfix and to use the appropriate protocols.

The configuration files for Dovecot are located at `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/`. Open the `10-mail.conf` file and make the following changes:

```
mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
```

This setting tells Dovecot to store messages in mbox format in the `~/mail` directory for each user, with the inbox stored in `/var/mail/%u`.

Next, open the `10-auth.conf` file and make the following changes:

```
disable_plaintext_auth = no
auth_mechanisms = plain login
```

These settings tell Dovecot to allow plaintext authentication and to use the plain and login mechanisms.

Finally, open the `10-master.conf` file and make the following changes:

```
service imap-login {
  inet_listener imap {
    port = 143
  }
}

service pop3-login {
  inet_listener pop3 {
    port = 110
  }
}
```

These settings tell Dovecot to listen on ports 143 and 110 for IMAP and POP3 connections, respectively.

5. Restart the services
After making these changes, you'll need to restart the Postfix, SpamAssassin, and Dovecot services to apply the new settings. You can do this with the following commands:

```
sudo systemctl restart postfix
sudo systemctl restart spamassassin
sudo systemctl restart dovecot
```

Roundcube installation ancd config

6. Install Roundcube
First, you'll need to install Roundcube on your Linux machine. If you're using a Debian-based distribution, you can install it using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install roundcube roundcube-plugins
```

This will install Roundcube and some additional plugins.

7. Configure Roundcube
Next, you'll need to configure Roundcube to work with your email server. The configuration file for Roundcube is located at `/etc/roundcube/config.inc.php`. Open it with your preferred text editor and make the following changes:

```
$config['default_host'] = 'localhost';
$config['smtp_server'] = 'localhost';
$config['smtp_port'] = 25;
$config['smtp_user'] = '%u';
$config['smtp_pass'] = '%p';
$config['smtp_auth_type'] = 'LOGIN';
$config['des_key'] = 'random_string';
$config['plugins'] = array('managesieve', 'password', 'markasjunk2');
```

These settings tell Roundcube to use your localhost as the default host and SMTP server, to use port 25 for SMTP, to use LOGIN authentication, and to enable some additional plugins.

8. Configure Roundcube's managesieve plugin
Roundcube's managesieve plugin allows you to create and manage Sieve scripts, which are used to filter and sort incoming messages. You'll need to configure this plugin to work with Dovecot's Sieve implementation.

The configuration file for the managesieve plugin is located at `/etc/roundcube/plugins/managesieve/config.inc.php`. Open it with your preferred text editor and make the following changes:

```
$config['managesieve_host'] = 'localhost';
$config['managesieve_port'] = 4190;
$config['managesieve_auth_type'] = 'PLAIN';
$config['managesieve_default'] = array('fileinto "INBOX";');
```

These settings tell Roundcube's managesieve plugin to use your localhost as the managesieve host, to use port 4190 for managesieve, to use PLAIN authentication, and to set a default sieve script.

9. Configure Roundcube's password plugin
Roundcube's password plugin allows users to change their email account password from within Roundcube. You'll need to configure this plugin to work with Dovecot's password database.

The configuration file for the password plugin is located at `/etc/roundcube/plugins/password/config.inc.php`. Open it with your preferred text editor and make the following changes:

```
$config['password_db_dsn'] = 'mysql://roundcube:roundcube_password@localhost/roundcube';
$config['password_algorithm'] = 'dovecot:SHA512-CRYPT';
```

These settings tell Roundcube's password plugin to use a MySQL database to store password information, and to use the SHA512-CRYPT algorithm to encrypt passwords.

10. Configure Roundcube's markasjunk2 plugin
Roundcube's markasjunk2 plugin allows users to mark messages as junk and to train SpamAssassin's Bayesian filter. You'll need to configure this plugin to work with SpamAssassin.

The configuration file for the markasjunk2 plugin is located at `/etc/roundcube/plugins/markasjunk2/config.inc.php`. Open it with your preferred text editor and make the following changes:

```
$config['markasjunk2_spam_flag'] = 'Junk';
$config['markasjunk2_move_to'] = 'INBOX.Junk';
$config['markasjunk2_spam_level'] = 15;
$config['markasjunk2_spam_command'] = '/usr/bin/sa-learn --no-sync --spam %F';
$config['markasjunk2_ham_command'] = '/usr/bin/sa-learn --no-sync --ham %F';
$config['markasjunk2_bayes_autotraining'] = true;
$config['markasjunk2_blacklist_threshold'] = -100;
$config['markasjunk2_whitelist_threshold'] = 100;
$config['markasjunk2_autotraining_threshold'] = 3;
```

These settings tell Roundcube's markasjunk2 plugin to use 'Junk' as the flag for spam messages, to move spam messages to 'INBOX.Junk', to set the spam level to 15, and to use sa-learn to train SpamAssassin's Bayesian filter. The other settings control how Bayesian training is performed and how messages are classified.

11. Restart services
After making these changes, you'll need to restart Roundcube, Postfix, SpamAssassin, and Dovecot to ensure that the changes take effect. You can do this using the following commands:

```
sudo systemctl restart roundcube postfix spamassassin dovecot
```

Now should now be able to access Roundcube at `http://localhost/roundcube` and use it to send and receive email.
